# Audio Processing Using Machine Learning

This GitHub repository contains a collection of audio processing techniques implemented using machine learning algorithms. The repository contains multiple Python scripts that demonstrate how machine learning can be used to process audio data for various purposes such as noise reduction, audio classification, and audio segmentation.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* numpy
* pandas
* librosa
* scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the repository's root directory.

## Contents

The repository contains the following Python scripts in the Notebook:

* `audio_classification.py`: A script that uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify audio files into different categories.
* `audio_segmentation.py`: A script that uses machine learning to segment an audio file into smaller segments based on the content of the audio.
* `noise_reduction.py`: A script that uses machine learning to reduce noise in an audio file.

## Usage

To use the scripts, simply run the desired script in the terminal or command prompt. The scripts take audio files as input and generate output files based on the processing technique used.

## Contribution

If you wish to contribute to the repository, feel free to create a pull request with your changes or open an issue for any bugs or feature requests.
